Installation instructions:

Option 1:
    Run the file with your shell interpreter straight out of the bin/ folder

Option 2:
    Place program.sh in your bin folder (defined in env var PATH, type env
    in your shell interpreter to see all variables) and you can invoke
    the program anywhere. To add a folder to your path, simply export
    a new environment variable with your folder in the end:

    export PATH=$PATH:~/bin
    
    This would add ~/bin folder to the path.
