Backup Reporting Utility program.sh

Copyright (C) 2016 Julius Salonen

This utility is meant to report on disk usage by various backup and temporary
files. It takes the directory set in arguments and produces a list of found
files, sorted list of counted files and a disk usage report of the counted
files. Fairly barebones.

Updates to script will be available at:
    https://github.com/fippefi/Backup-Reporting-Utility-program.sh

Currently reporting on following filetypes:

      *~      A backup file from editor
      *#      A temporary file from editor
      *.bak   A backup file
      *.bup   A backup file
      *.rej   A rejected file    

The reports are placed in TMPDIR, which is either from the environment var
TMPDIR, or provided by the user with --tmpdir DIR option.

Files generated:

    PID.files-list.lst      - ls -l List of all scanned files.
    PID.files-sorted.lst    - Sorted list of all backup files.
    PID.files-summary.lst   - Summary disk usage report on backup files.

See AUTHORS, COPYING and INSTALL for more information.
